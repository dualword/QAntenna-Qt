QAntenna 0.2:

* Improved GUI with menu and log text
* Added the render to file/clipboard functionality
* Capacity to open several antennas at the same time
* Set the initial frequency in the antennas as the NEC file describes it.
* Now changing the frequency and simulating actually simulates the new
  frequency :-)

  instance)
* Added camera "exploration mode", improved "orbital mode". The user can "run"
  while pressing shift.
* Added translations in many languages (see AUTHORS for more details)
* Deleted the linear/logarithmic scale option, as the later one was wrong and
  unnecessary.
* Changed the step of the sphere's radius size slider.

  vertex/colors/normals arrays.

* Original release
