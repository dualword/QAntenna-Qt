* QAntenna closes with an error in case of any parsing error.
* If a non-nec file is opened, QAntenna fails.

* Fix that qantenna suddenly quits if a (valid) NEC file is tried that
  does not happen to contain a RP card.

* Fix that qantenna suddenly quits if a GN card is encountered *before*
  a RP card. Other issues around this are features to be added,
  mentioned in TODO.

* Perhaps related to the previous bug above, qantenna does not display
  the results of a ground present, even though necpp does deliver the
  answers according to the input card requests.

* Qantenna has a serious anomaly pattern on a free space antenna shown
  up on an example known as "bigwheel.nec". Previously, this one had a
  very broken display that is now fixed, but the RP remains wrong.

* Fix angle rotation stepping anomaly where only part of the RP is
  delivered, even over a correct element display. The test example is
  a file known as 10-30m_vert.nec from the xnec2c distribution.


  Note: As of version ??? Nov 2010, there have been updates that will
  remove many bugs that were previously inevitable. It may also make
  visible a whole new set of bugs that previously simply could not
  be seen, being masked by the crash.
