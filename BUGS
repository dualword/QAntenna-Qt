* If a NEC file containing non-standard comment lines, sometimes
  using #, or ' or !, and not necessarily at the top of the file,
  Qantenna accepts the line, but continues to parse any integers
  and NEC card commands encountered in the comment.
  
  Possible fix is to have Qantenna simply skip over lines that
  begin with characters that cannot be part of a valid input line.
  
  Further, to pass on to necpp those lines beginning with characters
  that necpp will accept.
  
* Any CM comment line after the CE card provokes necpp to flag
  a geometry error, but causes Qantenna to crash out without letting
  the user know.
  
  A nice fix would be at least to stop with a message that this
  happened. Even better would be to move the CM ahead of the CE,
  and/or include a CM if it was missing.
  
* QAntenna closes with an error in case of any parsing error.
  We want Qantenna to quit (if it must) gracefully.
  If possible, to stay alive, but reject the file with a message
  
* If a non-nec file is opened, QAntenna fails.
