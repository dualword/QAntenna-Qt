* QAntenna closes with an error in case of any parsing error.
* If a non-nec file is opened, QAntenna fails.

* Fix that qantenna suddenly quits if a (valid) NEC file is tried that
  does not happen to contain a RP card.

* Fix that qantenna suddenly quits if a GN card is encountered *before*
  a RP card. Other issues around this are features to be added,
  mentioned in TODO.

  Note: As of version ??? Nov 2010, there have been updates that will
  remove many bugs that were previously inevitable. It may also make
  visible a whole new set of bugs that previously simply could not
  be seen, being masked by the crash.
