* Implement the scales in OGL (a way to show the magnitudes of the radiation
patterns, I (Lisandro) have some ideas of how to do them, but I didn't have
time to ellaborate them).
* Change the color of the antennas
* have a touchstone file export for the impedance so users can use it
e.g. in qucs to create the matching and feeding network (Thanks Stefan)

I (Graham) also have a wish list.

* Add a "Recent Files" choose list to the File Menu.
  How many are in the list should be settable somehow, say by a value in
  a user "Preferences" file which overides a "defaults" version kept
  wherever qantenna puts its resources. Having an expansive "Preferences"
  feature is not high priority right now, but if somebody knows how to
  set up the basic method, that would be welcome.

* Have qantenna display ground plane and radial structures, and offer
  display of infinite perfect, SOMNEC ground, free-space choices.

* Printable plots of RP projections horizontal and vertical. Also, plots
  of "slice" where the slice plane can be tilted and shifted. Slice
  outputs specified by card inputs have been a high-speed calculation
  feature of NEC2 since the beginning. Adding such features by using the
  handy dodge of artificially "adding in" a card line that was maybe not
  present in the original input is OK.

* Comparison plots in different colours for different conditions,
  e.g. one antenna compared to another, or same antenna at different
  frequencies.

* Frequency sweep, both as requested from file inputs, and interactive
  chosen by the user, again by artificially inserting card line inputs.
  The output set can then be displayed at spot frequencies using spinbox
  and/or animation. Related to this is cleanup of temporary files.

* Impedance, SWR and similar plots. Again, delivered if requested from
  card file content, or simply included anyway, regardless of card file
  input. These cursors on these should change in object-oriented fashion
  to match the current spinbox setting, and have cursors to aid getting
  numerical information from them. Multiple displays on the same graphs
  should have colours that match the colour of the corresponding antenna
  RP plot.

* Option for using density-gradient radiation pattern displays, so that
  3D displays of antenna can be compared, by using a different colour
  for each antenna. For single antennas, the present colour-spectrum
  display is very nice.

* Have the choice of gain displays Linear Power, Linear Voltage E-Field
  (to better show up side lobes), ARRL definition exp(0.05827*gain),
  and Logarithmic. these should be available for various polarization
  types, Near Field and Far Field. I have no idea yet what a nice
  user interface would be for these, nor what the defaults should be.

* Display of NEC warning outputs about file structures having geometric
  conditions that limit accuracy, such as unsuitable radius conductors,
  bad join angles, etc.

* An editor aid, able to modify/fix existing input files, and to create
  new antenna files from the beginning, save/save-as with warning about
  overwriting existing files.

* Scaling function, to be able to calculate the new antenna dimensions
  for an existing design, made for a new frequency. This feature has
  been available in programs even from the days of DOS only.

Much of this is beyond what I know how to do, but I am hoping some of
the skilled programmer folk out there may be able to help us get there.
