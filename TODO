* At the loading of an antenna, the UI should check for it's simulation
frequency
* We should check if a RP card is present in the NEC file, otherwise, we should
add it in order to hace radiation patterns. We may have to do the same for other cards
* Implement the scales in OGL (a way to show the magnitudes of the radiation
patterns, I (Lisandro) have some ideas of how to do them, but I didn't have
time to ellaborate them).
* Change the color of the antennas
* Do the UI widgets necessary to set the simulation parameters and the
associated code
* have a touchstone file export for the impedance so users can use it
e.g. in qucs to create the matching and feeding network (Thanks Stefan)
