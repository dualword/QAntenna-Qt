* Implement the scales in OGL (a way to show the magnitudes of the radiation
patterns, I (Lisandro) have some ideas of how to do them, but I didn't have
time to ellaborate them).
* Change the color of the antennas
* have a touchstone file export for the impedance so users can use it
e.g. in qucs to create the matching and feeding network (Thanks Stefan)
