/**
	This class is used to crate each patch of the antenna. It inherit its functions
	of primitive class which is a virtual one. It provides all necessary funtions
	to process the patches. It class has a label which indicate this primitive is a
	patch, 4 vertex, end1, end2, end3 and end4 to indicate line position. Tag
	Number doesn't contain tag number because patches haven't one. Some cards have
	more parameters that are saved in parameter and parameter1, but these are
	stored in lines. This class has also functions to modify patch position, how
	are move reflect, and rotate. Other fuction aren't used in the program but
	complete the class functionality. It's analogous to patch class.
